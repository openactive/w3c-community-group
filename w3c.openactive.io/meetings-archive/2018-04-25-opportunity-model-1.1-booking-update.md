## Summary

We had a discussion around the pending changes to the 1.1 version of the modelling opportunity data specification. There was some good feedback on the changes and I will be publishing a few minor changes as a result.

The major change in this version of the specification is the addition of the support for facilities. While we have discussed these changes a number of times, it would be good to have clear feedback from those that will be implementing this part of the specification that they feel it is useful.

The two relevant sections to review are:

[https://www.openactive.io/modelling-opportunity-data/EditorsDraft/#facility-use](https://www.openactive.io/modelling-opportunity-data/EditorsDraft/#facility-use)

[https://www.openactive.io/modelling-opportunity-data/EditorsDraft/#describing-facility-use-code-oa-facilityuse-code-](https://www.openactive.io/modelling-opportunity-data/EditorsDraft/#describing-facility-use-code-oa-facilityuse-code-)

Please provide any feedback by 30th April. If I don't receive any issues, then based on previous feedback I will publish the proposed changes.

Otherwise we can defer this until 1.2 which is scheduled for 1st July, giving more time for testing.
