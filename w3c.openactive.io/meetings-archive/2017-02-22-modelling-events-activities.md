# 2017-02-22 - Modelling Events, Activities

## Summary

Key topics of discussion were around:

* How to contribute to ongoing work \(see [slides](2017-02-22-modelling-events-activities.md#slides)\)
* Activities and activity lists. The proposed model seems to work for everyone so far
* As a later phase of work, how do we create a more standardised activity list?
* Need to think about a broader definition of "opportunity" to cover, e.g. orienteering and biking trails. These are not event based.
* Some discussion around the naming of the "programme"/"format"/"brand" aspects of events, more feedback required from operators.

Issue tracker is here:

* https://github.com/openactive/modelling-opportunity-data/issues

I plan to send a revised specification out for review by the end of the week.
