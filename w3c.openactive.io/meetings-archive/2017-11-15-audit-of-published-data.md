## Summary

During the call we discussed:

* Current state of standards adoption and aspects of the specs in use
* Whether there is interest/need in community to develop an open source data harvester to support developers in rapidly building applications
* The broad requirements around facilities data

Summary of use of standards in feeds is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ObKENXj3GxAbJuOJ2J3AOYF2MarX9FWFfytWxV9X25k/edit).

Actions from the meeting:

* Start wider discussion around availability of facilities, collecting example data from community and exploring whether extensions to standards are required
* Invite interested parties to meeting on either 11th/12th december to discuss an open source data harvester
* Review Active Places and how the facilities data it provides could be mapped to the opportunity data model and whether there are important properties to include
* Ensure that data model and other documentation highlights how Active Places venues/data can be cross-referenced with the open opportunity data
