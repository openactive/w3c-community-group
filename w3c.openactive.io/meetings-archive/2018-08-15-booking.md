# 2018-08-15 - Booking

## Summary

We reviewed progress on the booking API specification and several recent additions, including:

* Support for exposing terms and conditions and privacy notices
* Support for cancellations and refunds

The key conclusions are that:

* we need to add support for privacy notices, in addition to terms and conditions
* we should consider how best to provide this, often service level information, in ways that minimises repetition of data
* we need to support marketing opt-in information
* we need to be careful around conformance language re: marketing opt-in, etc to ensure that we are inline with current GDPR and marketing email guidance
* that as not all platforms support refunds, we cannot mandate refund/cancellation support, but it will be recommended
* there is a need to include windows during which cancellations/refunds can be accepted, and whether cancellations are allowed, to improve user experience of bookings
* we also agreed to review how URL discovery is currently specified to ensure we're avoiding need to replicate data in feeds
