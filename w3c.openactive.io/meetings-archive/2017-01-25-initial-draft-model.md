# 2017-01-25 - Initial draft model

## Summary

Discussion of this initial draft:

* https://www.openactive.io/modelling-opportunity-data/

Key questions considered:

* Do you think the key concepts \(Section 2\) cover the essentials of describing opportunity data?
* Do you have any comments on the definitions of each concept ? For example, how do they align with your existing models and/or data?
* Does the initial mapping to Schema.org types seem reasonable?
* What types of information do we need to help describe events & sessions? Are there existing categories that we can use, or that you can share with the group?

Discussion about describing events:
