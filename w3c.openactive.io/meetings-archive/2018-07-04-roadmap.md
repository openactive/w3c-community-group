# 2018-07-04 - Roadmap

## Summary

A quick status update on where we are with the specifications and a roadmap for moving forward with the modelling and booking specifications between now and end of August.

* Booking API specification is relatively stable, we need implementation

  feedback to continue

* Assuming we get this, we are aiming for Open Booking API 1.0 specification by 31st August, with revised editors drafts between now and then
* The next modelling specification updates will focus on Routes and Validation. This will be a 2.0 release due to some breaking changes
* Editors draft to be published before end of July
* Modelling Opportunity data specification to be published by 31st August

To support delivering that, the slides indicate what the focus of our calls with be for the next 2 months.

We'll refine our plans around activity lists following a f2f community meetup on 20th July.
