# 2021-09-29 - Requirements for the Membership Proposal

## Summary

The focus of the call was the proposal for dealing with memberships. As the proposal is complex and addresses multiple inter-related concerns (including account management, barcodes, and entitlement pricing), the purpose of the discussion was to ensure that requirements have been adequately specified.

Relevant documents are:

* the [Membership proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mjmb-si95H_YK9qeNIhyTBfstGI-2NPAycz0y78GYGc/edit#) itself
* the revised [high-level requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pb6DTu6cdZDHK\_4eSIIv3M3gyStD65Xg9irn8KTtBWo/edit#heading=h.mtanw1ypij6l) outline
