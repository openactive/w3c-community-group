# 2021-09-29 - Requirements for the Membership Proposal

## Summary

The focus of the call was the proposal for dealing with memberships. As the proposal is complex and addresses multiple inter-related concerns \(including account management, barcodes, and entitlement pricing\), the purpose of the discussion was to ensure that requirements have been adequately specified.

Relevant documents are:

* the [Membership proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mjmb-si95H_YK9qeNIhyTBfstGI-2NPAycz0y78GYGc/edit#) itself
* the [high-level requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vIz6vzM44d7wB9L2r2Q04Fv6bHdFZPZ-4D2Oot_xSP0/edit#) outline
