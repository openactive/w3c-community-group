# 2017-04-12 - Modelling Events, Activities

## Summary

We discussed this short doc \(1.5 pages\) that outlines a proposal for developing a shared activity list as part of this groups activities:

* Walk through of a [proposal for creating a shared activity list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-openactive/2017Apr/0001.html)
* Comparison of [Sport England and SportSuite lists](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-openactive/2017Apr/0002.html)
* Consensus was that a shared, hierarchical list would be both feasible to create and useful
* Need to properly scope the content of the list and approach iteratively, e.g. limit depth
* List needs to be versioned
* List needs to be updated on a regular schedule, perhaps 6-12 months
* Sport England and SportSuite lists can be used to seed the first version, merging them where appropriate
* We need to develop some clear editorial guidance to help focus and drive development of the list
* Aim for a phase one with limited detail, then expand as/when necessary

We reviewed EMD data capture fields:

* Jade stepped us through the fields that EMD use to describe events
* Disability support for events has been reviewed by Interactive, so follows best practice
* A number of fields useful for booking/event attendance that we should consider adding

Actions/Requests:

* Jade: to share EMD activity list
* Leigh/Jade/Kim/Becky/Nick: coordinate on creating initial version of the list
* All: provide feedback on the primer and specification
