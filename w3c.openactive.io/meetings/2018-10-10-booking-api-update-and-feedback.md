# 2018-10-10 - Booking API Update and Feedback

## Summary

A quick progress update on new developments:

* We have published the [V2.0 data model specification](https://www.openactive.io/modelling-opportunity-data/EditorsDraft/)
* Our [Validator ](https://www.validator.openactive.io)is up to date and conforms with the specification 
  * Open source, to be updated by the community as we continue to update the specifications
* We've launched our [Developer ](http://developer.openactive.io)site
  * Acts as a reference point for people who are starting to publish and use data as part of OpenActive
  * Aimed at developers, people looking to build applications against existing data feeds \(knowledge of JSON and data model\)
* We've made progress on our Booking API \([Booking 1.0 draft](https://www.openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/)\), and understand that the community needs more time to explore the specification. 
  * We would like to collate feedback from practical use

We had a discussion on how to structure and approach the booking API flow, exploring anonymous leases, 2-phase commit options, alternative 2-phase commits, and two-step payment options. The discussion centred around community feedback and thoughts on how to approach the booking API flow.
