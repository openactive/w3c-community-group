# 2024-10-23 - Routes Update

## Summary

We had an interesting discussion on the state of play of the specifications and various initiatives around sharing route information.

Startig with a quick Intro to the OpenActive's route guidance specifications, which initially focused on guided activities but expanded to encompass self-directed activities due to increased demand (especially around COVID). Sport England's interest stems from the accessibility and health benefits of outdoor activities.

**National Trust's path inventory** ([starts 2:38](https://youtu.be/z2uBhDEmYOQ?feature=shared\&t=158)). The National Trust has mapped its paths using OpenStreetMap, including details like path type (public right of way, permissive, etc.) and barriers (gates, stiles). They have not implemented all the optional attributes in the Route Specification v1.0, but there is alignment with the core aspects.&#x20;

There's a lack of consensus amongst providers regarding grading and accessibility standards. The National Trust is working on a comprehensive list of path attributes (80-100) and exploring consistent terminology with other organisations (e.g. Natural England, National Landscape Partnership). The focus is on “describing the path rather than the person” to allow users to make informed choices and the initial scope is walking / running.

Challenges include data capture for thousands of kilometres of paths, defining and consistently representing accessibility for diverse needs (wheelchair users, visually impaired, etc.), and standardising data collection across various organisations.&#x20;

**Slow Ways** ([starts 17:15](https://youtu.be/z2uBhDEmYOQ?feature=shared\&t=1035)) are creating a network of walking routes that connect all of Britain’s towns, cities and national parks. They piloted an interesting alternative data approach, using Uber's H3 hexagons to describe landscape characteristics and accessibility at different scales.

**British Cycling** ([starts 23:24](https://youtu.be/z2uBhDEmYOQ?feature=shared\&t=1404)) is interested in creating accessible cycling routes but faces similar challenges in defining accessibility for non-standard cycles. They have routes, including the Let’s Ride platform which has an OpenActive feed of group rides (though there are a few data issues there), and they also have clubs, which may not have a fixed base or location.

**Paddle UK** ([starts 27:34](https://youtu.be/z2uBhDEmYOQ?feature=shared\&t=1654))  wants to incorporate open data for paddle trails, including what is along the way, which can vary depending on river conditions.&#x20;

The **Stream Initiative** ([starts 29:12](https://youtu.be/z2uBhDEmYOQ?feature=shared\&t=1752)) - a number of Water Authorities are also exploring sharing data on routes and related activities at sites like reservoirs.

The **ODI and our role in OpenActive** ([starts 32:39](https://youtu.be/z2uBhDEmYOQ?feature=shared\&t=1949)) The Open Data Institute (ODI) works with governments and organisations to build and promote better data ecosystems and data infrastructure. We have been funded by Sport England to steward the OpenActive standards and specifications, provide technical support, and facilitate community engagement. The standards aim to encourage wider adoption of open data to promote physical activity.&#x20;

**Discussion** ([starts 35:54](https://youtu.be/z2uBhDEmYOQ?feature=shared\&t=2154)) around various issues, barriers and challenges to sharing data and getting people more active, and next steps.

**Next Steps: Strategic direction and outreach**

With National Trust, the ODI is exploring if there is more we can do to promote the work at a senior level to ensure the right organisations are included in conversations.

**Next Steps: Agreeing path attributes and terminology**

We will support and facilitate further work to reach consensus on the path attributes and to reflect this in the Route Guidance specification and guidance for publishers and consumers. We recognise the need to find the appropriate level of flexibility within the specification to balance standardisation with the needs of different audiences.&#x20;

**Next Steps: Supporting data publishers**

We’re also keen to support those implementing open data. Please get in touch if you’d like to arrange a chat about mapping your data to the Route Guidance data model, creating a data feed, or to share any feedback on the specifications and documentation.
