# 2025-02-19 Specification Development Plan

### Summary <a href="#summary" id="summary"></a>

We invite comments on the proposed priorities to end of June 2025:

* Interoperability with Open Referral UK to support social prescribing.
* Explore decoupling the OpenActive and OpenBooking specifications.&#x20;
* Evaluate requirements for improved OpenActive specifications / guidance / tools for describing routes, accessibility and safeguarding

Discussion then moves on to:

* Porism's earlier work mapping OpenActive to Open Referral UK formats.&#x20;
* London Sport's experience creating an ORUK feed from OA data.
* Supporting clubfinder capabilities for National Governing Bodies.
