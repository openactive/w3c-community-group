# 2023-02-15 Active Places

## Summary

Joined by colleagues from Active Places who share open data on sites and facilities, via an interactive mapping and reporting tool and by API. For more detail, see this [brochure](https://sportengland-production-files.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/2022-06/Active%20Places%20Power%20brochure.pdf).&#x20;

We discussed areas where the two data initiatives could potentially better align to maximise value - including Facility Types and Active Places IDs. As an example, if Active Places place IDs are included in OA opportunity data, activity finders could pull in up-to-date accessibility information at the site and facility level.

We outlined the new process for managing the OpenActive Activity List. Regarding change control, additions and reordering of the list should cause no problems but deletions would require wider discussion.&#x20;
