# 2023-01-18 Focus for year ahead

## Summary

After drawing attention to the draft [OpenActive Data Quality Reporting Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WCFR9Js\_NShTJeN1-aCIcSJNsPHTUHJ3mokvnC6Lt54/edit?usp=sharing), we discussed a proposed timeline for updates to some of the OpenActive tooling and then explored potential topics and issues to focus on over coming months.

The following topics were suggested, in no particular order:

* Accessibility
* Management of the Activity List and Facility List
* Github issues (e.g. high frequency / ad-hoc sessions)
* Interactions between OpenActive and OpenReferral
* Routes
* Places and links to Active Places
* Courses
* Processes (e.g. adding feeds to the catalogs)
