# 2022-12-07 Data Quality Reporting

## Summary

With an initial focus on the Discovery and Booking use cases, we discussed possible data quality metrics for the set of key data fields identified in previous calls. For example, reporting on the inclusion of either the activity location postcode or geographic coordinates to allow activity finder developers to search by location and to present opportunities on a map.&#x20;

We discussed briefly the OpenActive 'Activity List' and other lists in use across the sector. We discussed management of the list (separate to this W3C group); challenges in adding to and updating the list; and options to promote use of the list as reference data more widely.&#x20;
