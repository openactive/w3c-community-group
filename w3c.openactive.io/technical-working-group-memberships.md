# Technical Working Group (Memberships)

On 20 October 2021 it was decided to create a separate series of meetings for interested participants of the W3C group focused on the body of proposals for adding support for memberships to the Open Booking API. This group - referred to as the Technical Working Group (Memberships) - meets weekly for 90 minutes, in view of the scope and complexity of the proposal.

It should be noted, however, that the terms of reference and criteria of membership for the Technical Working Group are exactly the same as for the W3C group as a whole: all calls are open, and anyone interested in participating is welcome to join.&#x20;

To view the call schedule and for instructions how to join, see the OpenActive [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=b3BlbmFjdGl2ZS5pb182NDVraGk0NWJqaGNlMDZvc3FkbHM5dTkwMEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t).

Pages with slides, recordings, and notes from the calls can be found under the 'Meetings - Technical Working Group' heading in the left-hand column.
